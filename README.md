### About Me
I am from Pittsburgh, PA, but during the school year I call State College, PA home. I am a  senior Biostatistics major at Penn State University, and I am graduating in December of 2018. On campus, I am the president of the Penn State Statistics Club, an active member of Phi Eta Sigma Honor Society and Mu Sigma Rho, and volunteer with the Penn State Lion's Pantry and the THON organization ATLAS. When I'm not in class or at meetings, I love to cheer on the football and hockey teams, go for a run, or hang out with friends.

This past summer, I interned with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in the Quality Assurance Validation Department. My project was to perform different statistical analyses on validation data to showcase capability and detect differences in the data.

Something that not many people know about me is that I am a huge hockey fan. When the time came around to start my final project for my STAT 184 class, I just knew I had to do something with some hockey data. I decided to see if I could predict what stats a player needs to get into the hockey hall of fame. I produced a decision tree for each position for the odds of being inducted, and looked at how well it worked with some current hockey players. I then played around a little looking at the differences of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin and why they had a large difference in odds of being inducted into the HOF. It was a pretty simple analysis, but it produced some interesting results.

For Stat 462, regression analysis, myself along with my four other group members, Junchan Byeon, Alex Chen, David Chen, and Yinqi Zhang, decided to use the 2015 American Community Survey from the Census Bureau to see if we could develop models that could predict income and unemployment at a county level. The final model for predicting income used elastic net regression, while the final model for predicting unemployment rate used LASSO regression.
