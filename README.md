### About Me
Hi there, I'm Suzanne. I'm a Statistician and Data Analyst currently based in the Washington D.C. area where I manage national housing surveys.

I love everything about data — collecting it, cleaning it, making sure it’s accurate, and crafting visualizations that clearly tell a story. There’s something satisfying about turning raw numbers into actionable decisions or into visualizations that make complex data easier to understand.

When I’m not working with data, you’ll probably find me running long distances, exploring trails with my dog, or planning my next travel adventure. You'll find more information about me, my career, education, and projects that I have worked on below.

### Career

#### <ins>Statistician- Team Lead, United States Census Bureau</ins>

I’m currently a statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau, where I manage national housing surveys. My work spans everything from statistical programming and data processing to visualizations and project management. Some of my responsibilities and projects include:
* Create Tableau dashboards, R Markdown reports, and Excel reports used by executive leadership to monitor key survey metrics, identify data quality issues, and inform operational decisions and resource allocation.
* Lead a team of two analysts and collaborating with 50+ staff to support survey management activities such as large-scale data collection, data processing, quality control, data analysis and visualization, and data dissemination.
* Manage an 8-person cross-functional team of statisticians and programmers responsible for data processing and public data releases (you can find the data we release [here (SOMA)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/soma.html) and [here (AHS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs.html)).
* Write and/or Optimize SAS programs to automate quality control checks on large national survey datasets, streamline data review, or assist with any other project requests.
* Author technical sepcifications for new datasets or new data processing needs, overseeing the teams responsible for implementnation and quality review of the datasets or processing updates.
* Assist in additional projects such as developing a statistical model using historical response data to identify high-priority survey units, projects to geocode survey data, and a project to compile historical survey data to be easily accessible for data users. 
* Lead modernization initiative projects including updating survey datasets and programming to allow for integration with the Census API, and a project including a full rebuild of survey instruments and data architecture in order to migrate to a new system to improve data integrity, standardization, processing efficiency, and scalability.
* Develop training materials and reference guides for regional and field staff. Present to regional staff and field staff in both a management and training capacity.
* Manage two national housing surveys, ensuring sponsor needs, regulatory requirements, and data quality standards are consistently met.

### Portfolio

[Predicting if a NHL Player will be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame](https://smpapik.github.io/FinalProject184/FinalMarkdown) 

Something that not many people know about me is that I am a huge hockey fan. When the time came around to start my final project for my STAT 184 class, I just knew I had to do something with some hockey data. I decided to see if I could predict what stats a player needs to get into the hockey hall of fame. I produced a decision tree for each position for the odds of being inducted, and looked at how well it worked with some current hockey players. I then played around a little looking at the differences of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin and why they had a large difference in odds of being inducted into the HOF. It was a pretty simple analysis, but it produced some interesting results.

[Predicting Income and Unemployment in the United States R Code](https://smpapik.github.io/fin.R)

For Stat 462, regression analysis, myself along with my four other group members, Junchan Byeon, Alex Chen, David Chen, and Yinqi Zhang, decided to use the 2015 American Community Survey from the Census Bureau to see if we could develop models that could predict income and unemployment at a county level. The final model for predicting income used elastic net regression, while the final model for predicting unemployment rate used LASSO regression.
