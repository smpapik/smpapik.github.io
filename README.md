## About Me
Hi there, I'm Suzanne. I'm a Statistician currently based in the Washington D.C. area where I manage national housing surveys.

I love everything about data — collecting it, cleaning it, making sure it’s accurate, analyzing it, and crafting visualizations that clearly tell a story. There’s something satisfying about turning raw data into actionable decisions or into visualizations that make complex data easier to understand.

When I’m not working with data, you’ll probably find me running long distances, exploring trails with my dog, or planning my next travel adventure. You'll find more information about me, my career, education, and projects that I have worked on within this site.
