### About Me
Hi there, I'm Suzanne. I'm a Statistician currently based in the Washington D.C. area where I manage national housing surveys.

I love everything about data — collecting it, cleaning it, making sure it’s accurate, analyzing it, and crafting visualizations that clearly tell a story. There’s something satisfying about turning raw data into actionable decisions or into visualizations that make complex data easier to understand.

When I’m not working with data, you’ll probably find me running long distances, exploring trails with my dog, or planning my next travel adventure. You'll find more information about me, my career, education, and projects that I have worked on this page.

[Predicting if a NHL Player will be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame](https://smpapik.github.io/FinalProject184/FinalMarkdown) 

Something that not many people know about me is that I am a huge hockey fan. When the time came around to start my final project for my STAT 184 class, I just knew I had to do something with some hockey data. I decided to see if I could predict what stats a player needs to get into the hockey hall of fame. I produced a decision tree for each position for the odds of being inducted, and looked at how well it worked with some current hockey players. I then played around a little looking at the differences of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin and why they had a large difference in odds of being inducted into the HOF. It was a pretty simple analysis, but it produced some interesting results.

[Predicting Income and Unemployment in the United States R Code](https://smpapik.github.io/fin.R)

For Stat 462, regression analysis, myself along with my four other group members, Junchan Byeon, Alex Chen, David Chen, and Yinqi Zhang, decided to use the 2015 American Community Survey from the Census Bureau to see if we could develop models that could predict income and unemployment at a county level. The final model for predicting income used elastic net regression, while the final model for predicting unemployment rate used LASSO regression.
