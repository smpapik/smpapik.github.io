## About Me
Hi there, I'm Suzanne. I'm a Statistician based in the Washington D.C. area where I manage national housing surveys.

I love finding the stories hidden in data. Whether I’m cleaning, analyzing, or visualizing it, I enjoy the process of turning raw information into insights that inspire decisions and make complex topics more approachable. I also love programming — building tools, automating workflows, and writing code that makes working with data more efficient and creative.

When I’m not working with data, you’ll probably find me running long distances, exploring trails with my dog, experimenting in the kitchen, or planning my next travel adventure. You’ll find more about my background, education, and projects here on my site.
