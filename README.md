### About Me
I am from Pittsburgh, PA, but during the school year I call State College, PA home. I am a junior Statistics major at Penn State University, and I plan to graduate in December of 2018. On campus, I am the president of the Penn State Statistics Club, an active member of Phi Eta Sigma Honor Society, and volunteer with the Penn State Lion's Pantry and the THON organization ATLAS. When I'm not in class or at meetings, I love to cheer on the football and hockey teams, go for a run, or hang out with friends.

I have several projects in the works currently, so as soon as I finish them I will get them uploaded!

Something that not many people know about me is that I am a huge hockey fan. When the time came around to start my final project for my STAT 184 class, I just knew I had to do something with some hockey data. I decided to see if I could predict what stats a player needs to get into the hockey hall of fame. I produced a decision tree for each position for the odds of being inducted, and looked at how well it worked with some current hockey players. I then played around a little looking at the differences of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin and why they had a large difference in odds of being inducted into the HOF. It was a pretty simple analysis, but it produced some interesting results.
