### Recent Projects

- [Marathon Dashboard](https://smpapik.github.io/RunningDashboard/MarathonTrainingDashboard.html)
    - I recently ran a marathon, and used Strava to track every training run that I went on. After the marathon, I was looking through each of my runs and wanted an easier way to look at all the training I did. I also was hoping for another way to visualize the marathon run data, personalized to the actual run I completed. This dashboard was born from there.
    - The first tab on this dashboard includes insights and plots from the actual marathon. The value boxes along the top include key finisher statistics from the race. The animated gif was created using the GPX file of my marathon run, downloaded from Strava. The animated gif includes my pace and time elapsed as I went through the course and it also highlights the elevation changes throughout. The remaining plots offer more insight into the course elevation channges, my pace at at mile and at key splits, and my average heartrate at each mile.
    - The second tab on this dashboard dives deeper into the actual training period for the marathon. This tab used the Strava API to obtain all of the run activities from my training period (5/12/2025 - 10/25/20205). The value boxes along the top include the total number of runs, total  miles, and total minutes I put into the training. Under the value boxes is a calendar that highlights my running schedule, the number of miles, and my pace across the training period. Longer runs are indicated by a darker shade and days without data were rest days. The light grey squares without any data were periods of illness where I was unable to run. Below the calendar, I included histograms to visualize more information on the runs I completed in the training period and what the distributions of some of the key metrics looked like.
    - I hope to make one of these dashbaords for each marathon I run so that I can continue to visualize my training and compare runs over time. Additionally, I would like to start using this data to improve my training and rest periods to hopefully improve my marathon time.


### Graduate Projects & Reports 
- [Stat 484 Project](https://smpapik.github.io/DataExplorer-Package.html)
    - The purpose of this project was to pick a package in R and highlight how it can be used. I selected the DataExplorer Package since I believed it was extremely useful in assisting exploratory data analysis.
- [Stat 485 Project](https://smpapik.github.io/Stat485Project.html)
    - The purpose of this project was to complete a statistical analysis in R while utilizing different R packages and functions.

### Undergraduate Projects & Reports 

- [Stat 184: Predicting if a NHL Player will be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame](https://smpapik.github.io/FinalProject184/FinalMarkdown) 
    - Something that not many people know about me is that I am a huge hockey fan. When the time came around to start my final project for my STAT 184 class, I just knew I had to do something with some hockey data. I decided to see if I could predict what stats a player needs to get into the hockey hall of fame. I produced a decision tree for each position for the odds of being inducted, and looked at how well it worked with some current hockey players. I then played around a little looking at the differences of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin and why they had a large difference in odds of being inducted into the HOF. It was a pretty simple analysis, but it produced some interesting results.

- Stat 462:
    - [Predicting Income and Unemployment in the United States Presentation](https://smpapik.github.io/STAT462ProjectPresentation.pdf)
    - [Predicting Income and Unemployment in the United States Report](https://smpapik.github.io/STAT462-FinalReport.pdf)
    - [Predicting Income and Unemployment in the United States R Code](https://smpapik.github.io/fin.R)
        - For Stat 462, regression analysis, myself along with my four other group members, Junchan Byeon, Alex Chen, David Chen, and Yinqi Zhang, decided to use the 2015 American Community Survey from the Census Bureau to see if we could develop models that could predict income and unemployment at a county level. The final model for predicting income used elastic net regression, while the final model for predicting unemployment rate used LASSO regression.
